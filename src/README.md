## Modules
Modules are externally written contracts that can be permissionless plugged into Modulus. The Modules directory here contains the definitions
of required interfaces, proxy factory libraries, and examples. Externally written Modules are not kept here, although they can still be
accessed by Modulus users.

## Protocol
The protocol is the core code that defines Modulus. It is intended to be as minimal as possible so that the system is maximally customizable.
